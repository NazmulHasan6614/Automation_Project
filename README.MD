# Automated Testing with Selenium and Java

## Introduction
This document outlines the test strategy for automated testing of an e-commerce platform using Selenium WebDriver with Java. The strategy aims to establish an effective approach, objectives, scope, resources, and outcomes of the automation testing procedures.

## Test Objectives
The primary objectives of the automation testing effort include:
- Ensuring the functionality, usability, and robustness of key features on the e-commerce website.
- Increasing test coverage and efficiency through automation.
- Reducing manual effort and time in repetitive testing tasks.

## Scope
The automation testing scope covers the following features:
- User authentication (sign-in, login, password reset, add and remove from cart, filtering,checkout,logout)
- Account creation
- Product search, filtering, and sorting
- Cart operations (add, remove, update quantity)
- Checkout process (valid and invalid payment scenarios, address management)
- Order history and account management

## Test Strategy
The automation testing strategy involves:
- Designing and implementing automated test scripts using Selenium WebDriver and Java.
- Organizing test cases into test suites for efficient execution.
- Reporting test results and tracking issues using tools like TestNG or JUnit and Jenkins.

## Test Environment
The automation testing will be conducted in an environment similar to production, including:
- Web browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- Operating systems: Windows 10

## Test Deliverables
The deliverables for automation testing include:
- Automated test scripts in Java
- TestNG or JUnit test suites
- Test execution reports

## Schedule
The automation testing schedule is as follows:

| Activity                   | Start Date  | End Date    |
|----------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Test Script Development    | May 3, 2024 | May 10, 2024|
| Test Suite Creation        | May 11, 2024| May 14, 2024|
| Test Execution             | May 15, 2024| May 22, 2024|
| Report Generation          | May 27, 2024| May 28, 2024|

## Test Cases
The automated test cases will cover scenarios similar to manual testing, implemented using Selenium WebDriver and Java.

## Bug Reporting
Bugs identified during automation testing will be reported and tracked using the same process as manual testing, with integration into issue tracking systems like JIRA.

## Resources
The resources required for automation testing include:
- Automated test engineers proficient in Selenium WebDriver and Java
- Test automation frameworks: TestNG or JUnit


## Entry and Exit Criteria
**Entry Criteria:**
- Test environment is set up with necessary dependencies.
- Automated test scripts are developed and reviewed.


**Exit Criteria:**
- All automated test scripts are executed successfully.
- Test execution reports are generated and reviewed.
- Any critical bugs are resolved or documented for further action.

## Risk and Mitigation
**Risks:**
- Flakiness of automated tests.
- Maintenance overhead of test scripts.
- Compatibility issues with browsers or operating systems.

**Mitigation:**
- Regular review and maintenance of automated test scripts.
- Cross-browser and cross-platform testing to ensure compatibility.
- Continuous improvement of automation framework for stability and reliability.
